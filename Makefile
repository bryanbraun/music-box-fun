# I'm using "docker context use" on the migrate command because doing so fixed some errors.
# I had been using "-c", but it seemed like some parts of the command weren't executing on
# the remote host, resulting in some container IDs not being being found. This fixed it.
#
# Note: last time, I noticed that this "deploy" would build, stop, migrate, and restart the
# remote containers, but it didn't actually transfer my local image to the remote server.
# So last time, I did that manually (following these steps: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23938978/1154642),
# and then ran deploy-api (which worked). I should probably automate this in the near future.
#
# New note: I tried it again, and it worked like a charm, so maybe it's fine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
